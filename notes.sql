However, many renderers -- like Github's and *Markdown Here* -- support syntax highlighting. *Markdown Here* supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); to see the complete list, and how to write the language names, see the [highlight.js demo page](http://softwaremaniacs.org/media/soft/highlight/test.html).\n\n```no-highlight\nInline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.\n```\n\nInline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.\n\nBlocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks <code>```</code>, or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks -- they're easier and only they support syntax highlighting.\n\n```no-highlight\n ```javascript\n var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";\n alert(s);\n ```\n \n ```python\n s = "Python syntax highlighting"\n print s\n ```\n \n ```\n No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. \n But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.\n ```\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";\nalert(s);\n```\n\n```python\ns = "Python syntax highlighting"\nprint s\n```\n\n```\nNo language indicated, so no syntax highlighting in Markdown Here (varies on Github). \nBut let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.\n```\n\n(Github Wiki pages don't seem to support syntax highlighting, so the above won't be colourful (the strings are not red, for example). Try it out in a *Markdown Here* email or a Github Markdown README or Github Issue -- you can preview a new Issue without submitting it.)\n\nAgain, to see what languages are available for highlighting, and how to write those language names, see the [highlight.js demo page](http://softwaremaniacs.org/media/soft/highlight/test.html).\n\n<a name="tables"/>\n## Tables\n</a>\n\nTables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM and *Markdown Here* supports them. They are an easy way of adding tables to your email -- a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application.\n\n```no-highlight\nColons can be used to align columns.\n\n| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |\n| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|\n| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |\n| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |\n| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |\n\nThe outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily.

12	Building an AMD AM1 based HTPC - Part 1	After using a Raspberry Pi for a for a while as a stand in HTPC, I decided that something with a bit more grunt was necessary.\n\nPrimary reasons for this being:\n* Menus in XBMC are slow on RPi\n* RPi does not support HD Audio (not that I'm convinced I can hear much of a difference with it on my setup)\n* RPi does not have gigabit ethernet\n\nI already had the following suitable parts:\n* A MiniITX case - [M350](http://linitx.com/product/m350-universal-miniitx-enclosure-black/12488)\n* A power supply - 90w PicoPSU with 60w mains adapter\n* A hard drive - 120Gb Western digital caviar blue\n\nIn addition to these I purchased:\n* [AMD Athlon 5350 CPU](http://www.amd.com/en-us/products/processors/desktop/athlon) - £42.64\n* [ASUS AM1I-A MiniITX motherboard](http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/AM1IA/) - £26.64\n* 4Gb Corsair XMS3 DDR3 - £29.28\n\nfrom Scan, which came to £109 all in after postage, to form the basis of the new HTPC. \n\nThe Athlon 5350 isn't the most powerful of CPUs, or most bang for buck, but it does have the benefit of having very cheap motherboards. A cheap Intel based setup was tempting, but a suitable motherboard would have been nearer £45. Same goes for building something on the AMD FM2+ platform, especially if you're after a MiniITX motherboard.\n\nAs you can see from the pictures below, this didn't go entirely to plan! On the Asus motherboard, the CPU socket is slap bang in the middle, and this fouls the M350 HD tray whichever side you put it on. For the time being, I've unscrewed the fan from the heatsink and moved it across slightly. I'm hoping at some point in the future someone will release a low profile passive heatsink.\n\nOther than that, I'm fairly impressed with the hardware. Asus' UEFI firmware is miles better than that on my Gigabyte Z77 board from a couple of years ago, and the CPU runs relatively cool, even with my jerry-rigged fan\n\n<ul class="clearing-thumbs small-block-grid-4" data-clearing> \n<li><a href="/asset/11"><img data-caption="The newly purchased hardware" src="/asset/11"></a></li> \n<li><a href="/asset/10"><img data-caption="Motherboard in situ in case." src="/asset/10"></a></li> \n<li><a href="/asset/9"><img data-caption="Epic fail!" src="/asset/9"></a></li> \n</ul>\n        \n\nSoftware wise I went with my standard go to choices, Arch Linux and XBMC (with a small windows 8.1 partition just for testing). I'll talk about the install of these in my next post.\n\nThe second post is [here](http://www.maidavale.org/page/building_an_am1_based_htpc_part2)	t	building_an_am1_based_htpc_part1	1	2014-04-29 19:53:28.816+01	2014-05-02 23:33:50.952+01
13	Building an AMD AM1 based HTPC - part 2, software	After getting the hardware setup, I moved onto getting the software going.\n\nFirst, I installed Windows 8.1. This may seem a strange thing to do considering 99.99% of the time the box is going to be booted into linux, but it's definitely easier to install Windows first, and let it create it's UEFI partition, and install it's boot manager etc.\n\nI then resized the Windows partition, and installed Arch Linux. As we're using UEFI to boot, the disc uses GPT partitioning, so this is a bit different from normal MBR partitioning. For a boot manager I use Refind, which I've had good success with in the past. After installing Refind, Windows would not boot as Secure Boot complained that the UEFI setup had been tampered with. The Arch ISO does have a Linux Foundation Secure Boot keysigning tool on it, but in the end I gave up and turned off Secure Boot in the BIOS.\n\nAfter getting the basics installed and rebooting into the system for real, I started installing the necessary packages.\n\nA lot of this is personal choice, but I went with:\n\n* Boot manager - [Refind](http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/)\n* Display manager - [Lightdm](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/LightDM) with GTK greeter\n* Window manager/ desktop - [LXDE](http://lxde.org/)\n* Browser - Chromium\n* Improved fonts - [Infinality bundle](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Infinality-bundle+fonts)\n* Media playback - [XBMC](http://xbmc.org/)\n* Graphics drivers - [open source radeon driver](http://xorg.freedesktop.org/wiki/RadeonFeature/)\n* Assorted other packages: smartmontools, libcec, vlc, openssh, ntp, gvfs, plymouth, alsa, conky, base-devel, yaourt, smplayer\n\n### Resolving graphical problems\nWhen I fired up XBMC for the first time I was pretty disappointed. Firstly the frame rate was really low. Secondly there was bad tearing near the top of the screen.\n\nFirst I tried playing back the video in smplayer. No tearing, but frame rate was still bad.\n\nI figured out that the best video acceleration API to use with the open source radeon driver is [VDPAU] (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/VDPAU). Selecting this in XBMC however resulted in XBMC locking up. With acceleration set to software, there was enough CPU horsepower to decode most 1080p videos fine, but there was a nasty tear 1/5th of the way down the screen. Not good!\n\nEventually I ended up installing the XBMC Gotham beta (now RC) from the AUR (xbmc-beta) as well as xf86-video-ati-git. This worked better with VDPAU, but I was still getting the tear, although slightly nearer the top of the screen now.\n\nAfter some research it appears that this is an issue with libsdl detailed in this bug "\nlibsdl1.2 always uses backingstore which causes tearing in modern X servers " https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libsdl1.2/+bug/1280665\n\nTo resolve this, the easiest way is to turn off the backing store. I changed this in my lightdm config, setting \n\n```\n[SeatDefaults]\nxserver-command=X -bs -core\n```\n\n### Remaining issues\n\n* The version of lmsensors in Arch at the moment doesn't support the sensors in the ITE IT8623E Super IO. Support was added in this changeset http://lm-sensors.org/changeset/6242 so hopefully they'll release a new version soon. For the time being, I've taken ownership of and updated the SVN trunk package on the AUR https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lm_sensors-svn/\n\n* HD Audio - I've not yet had HD Audio working, either DTS Master Audio or Dolby TrueHD working on my Onkyo PR-SC886 receiver yet. At the moment the reciever only detests the DTS core audio, or I get No Signal with Dolby TrueHD. More tweaking required!\n\n* Windows Media Center remote is sending keyboard keypresses, need to get it working as a remote properly with LIRC\n\n* No CEC (using TV remote to operate XBMC).

15	Getting lm-sensors working on the Asus AM1I-A in Arch Linux	As of 04/2014 version 3.3.5 of [lmsensors](http://lm-sensors.org/) doesn't yet support the ITE IT8623E Super IO on the Asus AM1I-A meaning we can't get fan speed and temp readouts. Support was added in [this changeset](http://lm-sensors.org/changeset/6242) so hopefully a new version will be released soon. \n\nTo get this working in Arch Linux, I did the following:\n* In Arch, SVN trunk lm-sensors can be built using the following AUR package https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lm_sensors-svn/\n\n* After installing it, run sensors-detect(keep hitting enter saying yes to all the defaults), it should now detect the IT8623E as well as the temperature sensors built into the CPU\n'''\nTrying family `ITE'...

16	Making Windows Media Center remote work correctly in Arch Linux	At some point LIRC drivers became part of the kernel, and now by default remote controls generate normal keyboard key presses.\n\nThis should be fine, but my remote seems to generate way more key events than buttons are actually pressed, resulting in going through menus really fast etc. Because of this I decided to stick with the traditional lircd setup.\n\nFor reference, my MCE receiver identifies itself as following on startup:\n\n```\n[   14.036297] Registered IR keymap rc-rc6-mce\n[   14.036749] input: Media Center Ed. eHome Infrared Remote Transceiver (0471:0815) as /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:12.0/usb5/5-3/5-3:1.0/rc/rc0/input12\n[   14.037577] rc0: Media Center Ed. eHome Infrared Remote Transceiver (0471:0815) as /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:12.0/usb5/5-3/5-3:1.0/rc/rc0\n[   14.216355] mceusb 5-3:1.0: Registered Philips eHome Infrared Transceiver with mce emulator interface version 1\n[   14.216372] mceusb 5-3:1.0: 2 tx ports (0x3 cabled) and 2 rx sensors (0x1 active)\n[   14.216491] usbcore: registered new interface driver mceusb\n[   14.237439] IR JVC protocol handler initialized\n[   14.237664] input: MCE IR Keyboard/Mouse (mceusb) as /devices/virtual/input/input13\n[   14.239043] IR MCE Keyboard/mouse protocol handler initialized\n[   14.239062] IR NEC protocol handler initialized\n[   14.239085] IR RC6 protocol handler initialized\n[   14.239449] IR SANYO protocol handler initialized\n[   14.239468] IR Sony protocol handler initialized\n[   14.239482] IR RC5(x) protocol handler initialized\n[   14.251169] lirc_dev: IR Remote Control driver registered, major 250 \n[   14.252425] rc rc0: lirc_dev: driver ir-lirc-codec (mceusb) registered at minor = 0\n[   14.252431] IR LIRC bridge handler initialized\n```\n\nFirstly, I installed the lirc-utils package, and started the lircd daemon\n\n```\npacman -S lirc-utils\nsystemctl enable lirc\nsystemctl start lirc\n```\n\nThen check that remote events are being received. Start irw and press a few buttons:\n```\n# irw\n000000037ff07be1 00 KEY_UP mceusb\n000000037ff07be0 00 KEY_DOWN mceusb\n000000037ff07be0 01 KEY_DOWN mceusb\n000000037ff07bde 00 KEY_RIGHT mceusb\n000000037ff07bde 01 KEY_RIGHT mceusb\n000000037ff07bdf 00 KEY_LEFT mceusb\n000000037ff07bdf 01 KEY_LEFT mceusb\n000000037ff07bdf 00 KEY_LEFT mceusb\n000000037ff07bdd 00 KEY_OK mceusb\n000000037ff07bdd 01 KEY_OK mceusb\n000000037ff07bf0 00 More mceusb\n000000037ff07bf0 01 More mceusb\n000000037ff07bec 00 KEY_CHANNELDOWN mceusb\n```\n\nIf that works, see what protocols are enabled for the rc reciever.\n\n```\n# cat /sys/class/rc/rc0/protocols\n[rc-5] [nec] [rc-6] [jvc] [sony] [sanyo] [mce_kbd] [lirc]\n```\n\nWe're only interested in the lirc protocol, so only enable that one:\n\n```\n# echo lirc > /sys/class/rc/rc0/protocols\n```\nOnly lirc should then show as enabled\n\n```\n# cat /sys/class/rc/rc0/protocols\nrc-5 nec rc-6 jvc sony sanyo mce_kbd [lirc]\n```\n\nThe final step was getting it to work in XBMC!\n\nIf you look in the xbmc systemd unit file /usr/lib/systemd/system/xbmc.service, you'll see it startx xbmc with the following:\n\n```\n/usr/bin/xinit /usr/bin/dbus-launch /usr/bin/xbmc-standalone -l /run/lirc/lircd -- :0 -nolisten tcp vt7\n```\n\nThe  -l /run/lirc/lircd is crucial - by default xbmc expects to find the lirc device at /dev/lircd, so you need to pass this whenever starting xbmc.\n\nAll in this was pretty straightforward when I finally got it working. I did spend ages messing around with Lircmap.xml etc on the way though!	t	mce-remote-in-xbmc-on-arch	1	2014-05-04 21:01:45.116+01	2014-05-04 23:57:11.626+01

21	Digilent Nexys unrecognised device	I recently bought a [Digilent Nexys Spartan 3](http://www.digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?Prod=NEXYS) development board off eBay. A bargain for £28!\n\nOn connecting it to the computer however, it wasn't detected by the Digilent Adept tool at all under Linux, and under Windows the driver wouldn't install.\n\nThe device was reporting itself as having a VID:PID of 04b4:8613 - not what the driver INF files were expecting, so no wonder the drivers would not install.\n\nAfter some research, I discovered that the USB chip used on the Nexys is a [Cypress FX2LP](http://www.cypress.com/?id=193), which can have it's behaviour modified by programming an accompanying EEPROM. If the EEPROM gets corrupted, it reverts back to the default VID/PID.\n\nUnfortunately the Digilent firmware upgrade tool will only upgrade devices it recognises, so that is a non starter!\n\nIn the end, i found the following very helpful page that helped me out: http://www.makestuff.eu/wordpress/software/fx2tools/, and the following instructions in the comments (thanks Chris!):\n\n* Download the Digilent firmware update tool from http://digilentinc.com/Data/Software/Adept/Digilent_USB_Firmware_Upgrader.exe\n* Extract from this file donbusb.iic - this is the firmware.  (it's a self extracting zip, so can be expanded with any unzip tool)\n* Download and extract the fx2loader tool from http://www.swaton.ukfsn.org/bin/libfx2loader-20110913.tar.gz\n* Temporarily load the fpgalink firmware into RAM on the Cypress chip. This will enable us to perform EEPROM commands. fx2loader -v 04b4:8613 libfx2loader-20110913/firmware/firmware.hex \n* Program the original Digilent firmware back into the EEPROM: fx2loader -v 04b4:8613 Digilent_USB_Firmware_Upgrader/donbusb.iic eeprom\n\nUnder Windows you need to install the [LibUSB-Win32](http://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb-win32/files/libusb-win32-releases/1.2.6.0/libusb-win32-bin-1.2.6.0.zip/download) driver for the device on Windows. Download the zip and run bin/inf-wizard.exe; it will guide you through the process. Make sure you remove the current driver (if any) for the device.	t	digilent-nexys-unrecognised-device	1	2014-06-28 12:35:23.298+01	2014-06-29 11:50:30.614+01

32	Reading RAM SPD data on a Gigabyte Z77 Chipset motherboard under Linux	I was interested in reading the RAM timing of my memory under Linux. Turns out this can be done with the decode-dimms command, which is part of the i2c-tools package.\n\nTo get this to work I had to do several steps though:\n\nReboot and add the following kernel parameter: ```acpi_enforce_resources=lax```\n\nBy default this is set to strict, which meant that the i2c-i801 module was prevented from using the SMBUS controller. This could be seen from the following messages in dmesg:\n\n```\n[    2.338436] ACPI Warning: SystemIO range 0x000000000000f000-0x000000000000f01f conflicts with OpRegion 0x000000000000f000-0x000000000000f00f (\\_SB_.PCI0.SBUS.SMBI) (20140926/utaddress-258)\n[    2.338442] ACPI: If an ACPI driver is available for this device, you should use it instead of the native driver\n[    2.338471] i801_smbus 0000:00:1f.3: SMBus using PCI Interrupt\n```\n\nand looking at the ```lshw``` output, the SMBUS controller was unclaimed:\n```\n        *-serial UNCLAIMED\n             description: SMBus\n             product: 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family SMBus Controller\n             vendor: Intel Corporation\n             physical id: 1f.3\n             bus info: pci@0000:00:1f.3\n             version: 04\n             width: 64 bits\n             clock: 33MHz\n             configuration: driver=i801_smbus latency=0\n             resources: irq:18 memory:f7f15000-f7f150ff ioport:f000(size=32)\n```\n\nAfter rebooting with the kernel parameter, an additional dmesg line will be outputted indicating the conflict has been allowed\n\n```\n[    2.338436] ACPI Warning: SystemIO range 0x000000000000f000-0x000000000000f01f conflicts with OpRegion 0x000000000000f000-0x000000000000f00f (\\_SB_.PCI0.SBUS.SMBI) (20140926/utaddress-258)\n[    2.338441] ACPI: This conflict may cause random problems and system instability\n[    2.338442] ACPI: If an ACPI driver is available for this device, you should use it instead of the native driver\n[    2.338471] i801_smbus 0000:00:1f.3: SMBus using PCI Interrupt\n```\n\nFinally, the eeprom module needs to be inserted:\n\n```\nmodprobe eeprom\n```\n\nAfter that, ```decode-dimms``` should work as expected:\n\n```\n[root@orinoco ~]# decode-dimms        \n# decode-dimms version 6231 (2014-02-20 10:54:34 +0100)\n\nMemory Serial Presence Detect Decoder\nBy Philip Edelbrock, Christian Zuckschwerdt, Burkart Lingner,\nJean Delvare, Trent Piepho and others\n\n\nDecoding EEPROM: /sys/bus/i2c/drivers/eeprom/0-0050\nGuessing DIMM is in                             bank 1\n\n---=== SPD EEPROM Information ===---\nEEPROM CRC of bytes 0-116                       OK (0xE8AC)\n# of bytes written to SDRAM EEPROM              176\nTotal number of bytes in EEPROM                 256\nFundamental Memory type                         DDR3 SDRAM\nModule Type                                     UDIMM\netc....\n```	t	ram-spd-linux	1	2015-02-22 16:36:18.706+00	2015-02-22 17:08:11.723+00
33	Resolving issues linking with Boost libraries on Windows	Scenario: I was attempting to get my C++ CMake Qt/Boost based project building on Windows.\n\nI was getting linking errors such as: \n```\nLNK2019: unresolved external symbol "private: class boost::basic_regex<char,struct boost::regex_traits<char,class boost::w32_regex_traits<char> > >\n```\n\nSolution: Ensure Boost has been built for the correct architecture! (x86 vs x64)\n\nSteps taken:\n\n1. Installed Visual Studio Express 2013 Desktop (VS 2015 is still in RC)\n2. Installed the Windows 8.1 SDK\n3. Installed the Qt SDK including QtCreator\n4. installed CMake\n5. Installed Boost\n  1. Extracted Boost download to C:\\Program Files\\boost_1_58_0\n  2. Opened a VS2013 x64 Cross Tools command prompt\n  3. Run bootstrap.bat in the boost directory\n  4. Built 64 bit Boost libraries. This was the crucial part I had missed before, and by default b2 was generating x86 libraries. The address-model parameter is the key part\n```\nC:\\Program Files\\boost_1_58_0>b2 --toolset=msvc-12.0 architecture=x86 address-model=64 --with-regex --with-system --with-filesystem --build-type=complete stage\n```\n  5. Verify the libraries generated are 64 bit using the dumpbin tool. Look to see the "Machine" line says (x64).The libraries will have been output into stage\\lib in the previous step\n```\nC:\\Program Files\\boost_1_58_0\\stage\\lib\\>dumpbin /headers *.lib\n  Version      : 0\n  Machine      : 8664 (x64)\n  TimeDateStamp: 55463452 Sun May 03 15:44:34 2015\n  SizeOfData   : 00000058\n  DLL name     : boost_filesystem-vc120-mt-1_58.dll\n  Symbol name  : ?absolute@filesystem@boost@@YA?AVpath@12@AEBV312@0@Z (class boo\nst::filesystem::path __cdecl boost::filesystem::absolute(class boost::filesystem\n::path const &,class boost::filesystem::path const &))\n  Type         : code\n  Name type    : name\n  Hint         : 46\n  Name         : ?absolute@filesystem@boost@@YA?AVpath@12@AEBV312@0@Z\n```\n6.

36	Now using SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt	Up until today I was just using self signed SSL certificates for this site, as only really cared that the communications were secure end-to-end.\n\nI'm now using free certificates provided by [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), a new certificate authority from the Linux Foundation that provides free certificates for all, and has a nice automatable method for renewing the certificates. This is necessary as the certs are only valid for 90 days (intentionally, for security reasons). Free certificates have been available before from StartSSL, but it was awkward to use. Let's encrypt seems to be getting lots of attention, and some big industry sponsors including Mozilla, Cisco and Google Chrome.\n\nI found this article [How To Secure Nginx with Let's Encrypt](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-14-04) really useful as the nginx plugin for Let's Encrypt is still in an alpha state and not recommended.\n\nOnce I'd got it working I generated a secure SSL config with no old ciphers enabled using [Mozilla's SSL config generator](https://mozilla.github.io/server-side-tls/ssl-config-generator/)\n\nFinally, to test my configuration I used [Qualys' SSL Server Test](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=maidavale.org) which after using the above configuration gives the site's SSL config an 'A' security rating.	t	lets-encrypt	1	2016-01-17 20:10:38.568+00	2016-01-17 20:21:02.364+00

37	Reviving arduino with the Gertboard Raspberry Pi board	My arduino had spontaneously stopped working, and after a bit of diagnostics I came to the conclusion that the AVR itself was the cause of the problems. Fortunately I have another device capable of programming the AVR bootloader via ICSP, the Gertboard. After swapping the AVR chips round, I was able to reprogram the bootloader (and reset the fuse values)  using the normal arduino UI, and then the chip worked fine once placed back in the Arduino board! I'm still none the wiser as to why the chip became inoperable...\n\nSome commands I found useful along the way: \n\nWrite fuse values with:\n```\navrdude -qq -c gpio -p atmega328p -U lock:w:0x3F:m -U efuse:w:0x05:m -U lfuse:w:0xFF:m -U hfuse:w:0xDA:m\n```\nRead fuse values with:\n```\navrdude -c gpio -p atmega328p -U lfuse:r:-:h -U hfuse:r:-:h -U efuse:r:-:h\n```\nNote that these are using an avrdude customised for the Gertboard available as a debian package from https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/gertboard/	t	reviving-arduino-with-gertboard	1	2016-03-08 22:11:51.178+00	2016-06-30 21:02:44.466+01
